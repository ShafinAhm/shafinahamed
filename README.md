Whispers of the Sky

Beneath the sky, a quiet song,
Where stars and moonlight dance along,
The winds, they whisper through the trees,
A soft embrace, a gentle breeze.

The world, it turns, so slow, so vast,
A fleeting moment, but it will last,
In every step, a story told,
Of days gone by and dreams of gold.

So let your heart be light, be free,
Like waves that kiss the endless sea,
And in the stillness, you will find,
The peace that echoes through your mind.
